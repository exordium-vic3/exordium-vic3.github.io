Exordium is a peer-reviewed alternate history timeline and open source mod for Victoria 3. The timeline begins with numerous independent PODs in the 1800s and ends in 2020, and the mod begins in 2020 and ends around 2040. There are two co-existing premises of Exordium.

The first premise of Exordium is a universe where prior divergences ensures that the Co-Prosperity Sphere emerges victorious from the Second World War despite the failure of the European Axis, and the resulting Cold War ends in d√©tente.

The second premise is that a Third World War occurs in the 2030s between an AI system aiming to unify the world and the rest of humanity represented by the League of Nations.

This is the open-source branch of Exordium.
